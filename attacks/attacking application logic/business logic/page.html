</b><br/>
Test if malicious data can be injected into application so that app will consider them as validated/secure.<br/>
For example in multistage process examine if some parameters are passed in more than in one process. If so,<br/>
try to tamper parameters in later stage.<br/>
Application/system must ensure that only “logically valid” data is accepted at all input and hand off points of the applica- tion or system and data is not simply trusted once it has entered the system.<b><br/>
